Is this possible to build a community website without backend ?
answer: yes, of course!, and if backend does not exist, it may be more secure.
So, try Jay web!.

The feature of Jay web

1. lifecycle base web without backend & DB
   But, Apollo server has a role as backend(semi)

2. react hook form & apollo collabration

3. My own customizable side bar(with cookies) as a reusable component that can be used any project
