## Some features of Jay web

         1. Memory lifecycle dependent backend server which means Jay web
         does not have traditional DB (such as MongoDB, MYSQL...) But,
         Apollo server has a role as backend. Therefore, there are
         advantages and disadvantages.


         2. Much faster when fetching Open API data to the client because
         of the power of GQL in Aopollo.


         3. Bcrypt and token are used for little security on user&#39;s
         password.


         4. My own customizable side bar(with cookies) as a reusable
         component that can be used to other project.

         5. react hook form used for input validation check.
